title: Nothing is Unrealistic
---

The human life is something that has been changing since our inception into this world. From the biblical scripts or science it is evident that things have drastically changed over time. Comparing the olden days to today, as much as lots of tasks are being simplified by technology and innovations sprouting up day in day out, there is still a lot to do.


Have you ever been interested in taking part in today's technology and inventions? One way to do that is by being the guy that will offer expertise, in making software, that will ease how people do their day to day activities. Software developers  are the creative minds behind computer programs. They can develop applications that people can use to do specific tasks on different devices in addition to developing the underlying systems that run the devices or that control networks.

###### What it takes?
Have you ever imagined how far  you would be and what you would have achieved if certain things were introduced to you at a  tender age when your mind and thoughts were still fresh. I remember when I was young, I saw someone typing very fast and I wondered how possible that was using both hands while for me I couldn’t even figure out where the keys were in the qwerty keyboard. Also from movies you could see people even from a tender age operating computers like it was nothing which to us was a big deal to even just get to use one. The thing is at such a tender age if I was making use of the devices and knowledge was being shared on how to do this and that probably by now things will be so different.  With the few things that used to be there that really fascinated us is what drew me to the world of computing. I remember when I did just a simple task with spread sheets which to some it was an amazing thing that got me to dig deeper and deeper.


Being a software developer, one has to be passionate,persistent and resourceful. Software developers are go getters for their own targets, willing to rise again and again after every trial in vain. You just have to take a small break, think from another perspective and come back to trying it again till you find the light. With this you will even find that you have accomplished what you intended to do and at the same time learnt a lot of things from a simple task that was once a big thing to you.

###### Push yourself
Never say never because limits, like fears, are often just an illusion. Just because you find something to be very complex doesn’t mean it is. Try and tackle it head on and you will be surprised to find out that it was just something very simple that you even didn’t think of at first. You will never know your limits unless you push yourself to them and learn while building more and more.

###### Keep good company
Surround yourself with those in the same mission as you and you will have a lot to learn. Hang around people who share similar interests as you. You will always be encouraged and motivated to focus on your dream, passion or ideas.

###### Learn how to learn
I remember recently I met a guy from one of the big tech companies and he told me that, if I want to be hired easily in this big tech companies, then I have to master a language well from basics to complex things. To him, though frameworks are good,one has first to be knowledgeable with the core things so as to be able to adapt easily with the new frameworks and technology that come in day by day. Technology changes and one has to grow.


Last but not least, greatness exists in us all. Nothing is unrealistic we just have to believe in ourselves. So do u believe in yourself?
